# Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to classify phishing and legitimate websites using URL structure, domain properties, and security-related features.

The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end ML pipeline including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
